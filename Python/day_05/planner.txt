notes:
- keep track of location numbers to compare at the end
- what kind of map should not be important, just go in order
- seed is the source, soil is the destination

Procedure:
* parse ALL maps into arrays of tuples of destination range start, source range start, and range length
* put each map into an array (ordered)
* for each seed number:
    * get destination number from first map using parameters of source number (seed number first time) and map entries
    * using that destination number, repeat previous task above
    * repeat process until all maps have been gone through
    * after process is over, save final destination number in an array
* compare each number in array to find the lowest
* return that
